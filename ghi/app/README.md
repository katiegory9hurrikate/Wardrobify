# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm lint`

Runs ESLint on all JavaScript and JSX files in the project, ensuring that your code adheres to specified coding standards and style guidelines. It also reports any unused eslint-disable directives and sets the maximum number of warnings to 0, meaning the command will fail if there are any warnings.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://vitejs.dev/guide/static-deploy.html#deploying-a-static-site) for more information.
